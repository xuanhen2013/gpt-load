# Third-Party Notices

GPT-Load includes third-party open-source software. This file covers the
components that require specific attribution, carry obligations beyond
attribution, or are modified by GPT-Load. Each release also ships a CycloneDX
SBOM (`bom.cdx.json`) inventorying the resolved Go module graph.
